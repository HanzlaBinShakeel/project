# Project Evaluation Report

## Current Score: 46.2/100

### Why Not 100%?

The evaluator requires:
1. **Real GitHub/Bitbucket Repository** (40% of score)
   - PRs can only be analyzed from actual GitHub/Bitbucket repos
   - Local git repos cannot be analyzed for PRs
   - This is the main limitation

2. **More Code** (Currently: 700 LoC)
   - Target: 10,000+ lines of code
   - Need to expand functionality significantly

3. **More Commits** (Currently: 2)
   - Target: 50+ commits
   - Need more development history

### What We Have ✅

- ✅ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Test Framework (pytest)
- ✅ Test Files (6 test files, 304 test LoC)
- ✅ Well-structured code
- ✅ Modular design
- ✅ Clean code organization

### To Achieve 100% Score

#### Option 1: Push to GitHub (Recommended)
1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push this code
3. Create PRs that include:
   - Test files
   - 5+ files changed
   - Linked to closed issues
   - Meaningful code changes

#### Option 2: Expand Local Project
1. Add much more code (10,000+ LoC)
2. Create 50+ commits
3. Note: Still won't reach 100% without PRs

### Repository Metrics Breakdown

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Total LoC | 700 | 10,000+ | ⚠️ Need more |
| Commits | 2 | 50+ | ⚠️ Need more |
| Test Files | 6 | 20+ | ✅ Good |
| CI/CD | Yes | Yes | ✅ Good |
| PRs | 0 | 1+ | ❌ Need GitHub repo |

### Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Create repository and push code
2. **Create PRs**: Make PRs with tests and proper structure
3. **Expand Code**: Add more modules and functionality
4. **More Commits**: Continue development with proper commit history

### Maximum Possible Score (Local Only)

Without a GitHub repository for PR analysis:
- **Maximum: ~60/100** (Repository metrics only)
- **Current: 46.2/100**

To reach 100%, you **must** have a real GitHub/Bitbucket repository with proper PRs.
